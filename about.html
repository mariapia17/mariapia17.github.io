<center> <h1>About Me</h1>
Hey guys, brief moment of self-promotion here that has nothing to do with my great love for Advertising.
<br>
Maria Pia Jaramillo is my name. 
<br>
Iâ€™m an Advertising student at Miami International University.
<br>
I love long walks on the beach as well as eating chicken wings and spending my free time watching sports.
<br>
Red Sox's fan.
