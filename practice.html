			<h3>Market</h3>
			<p>The pet industry is a large and expanding market. The most rapidly growing market
segment is pet products and supplies, which represents 5.5% of the market. The segment is
projected to increase from $5.2 billion to $6.9 billion in the next five years, according to
business Communications Company Pet Industry study. The reason for this tremendous
growth in pet products and supplies is the growing number of pet owners and pets.</p>

million dogs in the U.S. alone, with nearly 40% of households owning at least one dog. In
fact, there are actually more households in American with dogs than households with kids,

devices. Our four-legged friends have an increasing array of smart collars from which to
choose. The market for pet products has been growing rapidly with demographics driving
the demand for pet supplies. Aging baby boomers are filling their empty nests with pets,
while the number of households with children from 5 to 15, the core pet market, keeps
climbing as well.</p>
